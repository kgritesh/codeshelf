I am Ritesh Kadmawala, cofounder and CTO at [Loanzen](https://loanzen.in). This is my small den on internet. 
I am a big time sports buff and an avid supporter of [Indian Cricket Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team),
[Liverpool Football Club](www.liverpoolfc.com/), [San Antonio Spurs](www.nba.com/spurs/) and 
[Rafael Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal). I also loves reading and having random discussion with 
friends about anything and everything.

This blog is my humble attempt to bring to light the amazing engineering behind some of the great open source
libraries that i use everyday. My sincere hope is to help fellow developers to get better understanding of these
black boxes and inspire them to contribute more towards these projects.

This blog is powered by the amazing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the elegant [hyde](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde/) theme. It is hosted
on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Thanks a ton to all of you. The source code of this blog can be found [here]().
